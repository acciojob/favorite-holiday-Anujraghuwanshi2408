	<h1>vrindavan</h1> <br>
	<p>Vrindavan (pronunciation (help·info); IAST: Vṛndāvana), also spelt Vrindaban and Brindaban,[2] is a historical city in the Mathura district of Uttar Pradesh, India. It is located in the Braj Bhoomi region and holds religious importance in Hinduism as Krishna spent most of his childhood days in this city.[3][4][5][6] Vrindavan has about 5,500 temples dedicated to the worship of Krishna and his divine consort Radha.[7]

It is one of the most sacred places for Vaishnavism tradition.[3][7] Vrindavan is a significant part of the "Krishna pilgrimage circuit" which also includes Mathura, Barsana, Gokul, Govardhan, Kurukshetra, Dwarka and Puri.[8][9]</p>
